      <span>Step 1</span>
      Open 2 x 400g tins of chickpeas and drain, reserving 2 tbsp of the brine.
      Put half the chickpeas into a food processor and whizz for 30 seconds,
      then 1 tbsp of the reserved liquid, 2 finely chopped spring onions, 4
      crushed garlic cloves, 1 tsp ground cumin, 1 tsp ground coriander, a pinch
      of allspice, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp baking powder, 4 tbsp flour and a large
      bunch each of fresh parsley and coriander.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Step 2</span>
      Whizz again until smooth and well combined, then add the remaining
      chickpeas and whizz very briefly â€“ you want the second addition of
      chickpeas to stay coarse in the mixture. If the mixture seems a little
      dry, add more of the reserved liquid until you achieve the desired
      consistency.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Step 3</span> Spoon the mixture into a bowl and chill in the fridge
      for 30 mins.
    </p>

      <span>Step 4</span>
      Meanwhile, make the herby humors. Add 1 x 400g tin drained chickpeas, 3
      tsp tahini and a couple of teaspoons of cold water to the food processor
      and blitz for 2-3 minutes, until smooth. Add in the 1 crushed garlic
      clove, 1 tsp salt, 3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, the juice of 1/2 a
      lemon, and a large pinch of paprika. Blitz again until the humors is very
      smooth, adding more water if the mixture is too thick. Add a small bunch
      of chopped fresh parsley or coriander and blitz until well-distributed.
      Spoon into a bowl and chill until required.
